In traditional IT infrastructure, specialized computers (servers) would be purchased and set up at the company to do things like store customer data in a database, or serve the company's website. The problem with this setup is that it's less flexible (leaving resources unused at low-traffic times, running the risk of servers being overloaded at high-traffic times) and requires on-site server maintenance expertise. Some small or niche organizations still use 100% on-premises computing (e.g. because of special security needs), but nowadays most have moved to using some kind of cloud platform.\n", "\n", "On a cloud platform, server resources are typically available \"on-demand\", meaning that the amount of storage space or CPU time scales based on user needs, and the user pays accordingly.
